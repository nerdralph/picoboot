The bootloader needs to implement a USB client.  It is based the V-USB code
with modifications to reduce code size and simplify the hardware.

I suggest running the AVR at 3.3v with a 1.7v red LED from Vbus (which doubles
as a power LED).  Two pins from the AVR connect directly to the D+ and D-
lines - no other components required.
